# Clean-Web-Design-Demo

### Built this single-page website with native CSS. No frameworks used.

The purpose of this project is to hone my skills with Clean and Responsive Web Design. The output is a virtual e-commerce website that I created by following along a Udemy course called "Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3".
